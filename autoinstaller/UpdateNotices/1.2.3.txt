=======================\Zn\ZB

\Zb\Z4# Pre-update tasks\Zn\ZB

\Zb\Z4## Plugins\Zn\ZB

Major changes were made in the plugin API, which break compatibility with old plugins versions. Therefore, before updating to this new version, you must disable all plugins.

Once the update is done, you must update each plugin by uploading the last version available from our plugin store.

Be aware that some plugins are not yet ready for use with this new version, such as the \ZbMailman\ZB and \ZbOwnDDNS\ZB plugins which require further works.

Plugin which are known to work with this new version clearly states that they are compatible with i-MSCP version >= \Zb1.2.3\ZB.

\Zb\Z4## Event listeners\Zn\ZB

Be aware that the transitional \ZbiMSCP::HooksManager\ZB package, which was an alias of the \ZbiMSCP::EventManager\ZB package since i-MSCP version \Zb1.1.14\ZB, has been removed. Thus, if you're using that package name in one of your listeners, you must change it to \ZbiMSCP::EventManager\ZB, which is the real package name.

\Zb\Z4## PHP version in use\Zn\ZB

If you're using, either \ZbDebian Wheezy\ZB or \ZbUbuntu Precise\ZB with a PHP version that is not provided by official repositories, you must be aware that the \Zbphp-apc\ZB package has been added in the list of package to install.

Because that package is no longer provided for PHP versions > \Zb5.4\ZB, you must remove the package from the packages file before upgrading, else, packages installation will fail.

You can find the packages file inside the i-MSCP archive, under the \Zbdocs/<distro>\ZB directory.

\Zb\Z4## Services\Zn\ZB

Because upstart jobs were added in this new version, you must stop all i-MSCP services manually before updating, else, some of them will be unable to restart at the end of process.

You can stop the i-MSCP services as follow:

        \Zb# service imscp_panel stop
        # service imscp_daemon stop
        # service imscp_network stop\ZB

\ZbNote:\ZB The imscp_panel service is only available if you're upgrading from a version released under the i-MSCP serie \Zb1.2.x\ZB

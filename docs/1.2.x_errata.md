# i-MSCP 1.2.x -- Errata

## Update to version 1.2.3

### Supported distributions

Support for both Debian Squeeze ( 6.x ) and Ubuntu Lucid Lynx ( 10.04 ) has been removed. If you want to update to this new
version, you must first update your distribution to either:

* Debian  Wheezy ( 7.x ) or Debian Jessie (8.x) if you're using Debian
* Ubuntu Precise Pangolin ( 12.04 ) if you're using Ubuntu

### Pre-update tasks

#### Plugins

Major changes were made in the plugin API, which break compatibility with old plugins versions. Therefore, before
updating to this new version, you must disable all plugins.

Once the update is done, you must update each plugin by downloading the latest version available from our plugin store.
Be aware that some plugins are not yet ready for use with this new version, such as the **Mailman** and **OwnDDNS**
plugins which require further works.

Plugins which are known to work with this new version clearly states that they are compatible with i-MSCP version >=
**1.2.3**.

##### Event listeners

Be aware that the transitional **iMSCP::HooksManager** package, which was an alias of the **iMSCP::EventManager**
package since i-MSCP version **1.1.14**, has been removed. Thus, if you're using that package name in one of your
listeners, you must change it to **iMSCP::EventManager**, which is the real package name.

#### PHP version in use

If you're using, either **Debian Wheezy** or **Ubuntu Precise** with a PHP version that is not provided by official
repositories, you must be aware that the **php-apc** package has been added in the list of package to install. Because
that package is no longer provided for PHP versions >= **5.4**, you must remove the package from the packages file before
upgrading, else, packages installation will fail.

You can find the packages file inside the i-MSCP archive, under the **docs/<distro>** directory.

#### Services

Because upstart jobs were added in this new version, you must stop all i-MSCP services manually before updating, else,
some of them will be unable to restart at the end of process.

You can stop the i-MSCP services as follow:

```shell
# service imscp_panel stop
# service imscp_daemon stop
# service imscp_network stop
```

**Note:** The imscp_panel service is only available if you're upgrading from a version released under the i-MSCP serie
**1.2.x**

### Info for plugin's developers

#### Plugin API changes

##### New plugin.plugin_config_prev database field

A new **plugin.plugin_config_prev** database field as been added, which allows to store the previous plugin configuration.
This field is automatically filled by the plugin manager and you should never update it manually.

From the frontend, you can access the previous plugin configuration parameters using one of the following methods:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<strong>iMSCP_Plugin::getConfigPrev()</strong>
 		</td>
 		<td>
 			Allows to retrieve all previous configuration parameters
 		</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
 		<td>
			<strong>iMSCP_Plugin::getConfigPrevParam()</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
			Allows to retrieve a single previous configuration parameter
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

From the backend, you can access the previous plugin configuration parameter using the **config_prev** property of the
plugin.

Be aware that usage of parameters from previous configuration is only relevant in the **disable()**, **update()**,
**change()** and **uninstall()** methods, whatever the context ( from the frontEnd or the backend ). Indeed, once the
**change()** method has been run successfully, the **plugin_config_prev** field is filled with the last configuration
applied on the plugin ( the configuration coming from the **plugin_config** field )

More generally, the parameters coming from the previous configuration allow to do some deconfiguration / uninstallation
tasks.

##### New plugin properties ( backend )

From now, the plugin manager automatically decodes the plugin info, config and config_prev fields and sets them as plugin
properties. Thus, it is not longer required to fetch these fields manually nor decode them.

To be more clear, the following news properties are set on plugin instances:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<strong>info</strong>
 		</td>
 		<td>
 			Property which contains decoded plugin info field
 		</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
 		<td>
			<strong>config</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
			Property which contains decoded plugin config field
		</td>
	</tr>
 	<tr>
 		<td>
			<strong>config_prev</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
			Property which contains decoded plugin config_prev field
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

##### New require_api info field

The new plugin API version introduces a new plugin info field ( **require_api** ), which allows you to define the i-MSCP
plugin API version that is required by your plugin in the info.php file. Thus, by declaring this field ( mandatory ), it
is no longer needed to implement API version compatibility check in the main plugin class. All is now done automatically
by the plugin manager, based on the value of the require_api field.

#### Backend changes

##### New CustomDNS module

This new version comes with a new **CustomDNS** module which allows to process custom DNS records without involving a
rebuilt of files which belong to HTTP server implementations ( vhost file, php files... ). This also allows to process
the custom DNS records more faster than before because from now they are managed by a dedicated module.

In past, each time you wanted add or delete a custom DNS record, it was mandatory to rebuilt the full configuration of
the domain ( vhost file, php file .. ). This involved a lot of tasks done for nothing and this was not without pose any
problems such as the useless reload of Apache ( eg. when using a plugin such as OwnDDNS which needs to update the DNS
zone files very often ).

From now, if you want add your own DNS records, you must simply add them into the **domain_dns** table with the correct
status ( eg. toadd ) and trigger a backend request ( only needed if you add the record through the FrontEnd ).

**Note:** All this also apply to the listeners files.

## Update to version 1.2.1

### Package's restricted SQL users

The minimum length for usernames and passwords is now 6 characters long. Due to this change, it is possible that during
the update you need to update them.

### Webmails

Multiple webmails are now supported. You can install either no webmail, one webmail or many webmails at same time. You
can reconfigure list of webmails to install by running the following command:

```shell
# perl imscp-autoinstall -dsr webmails
```

At this moment Roundcube and RainLoop webmails are available.

## Update to version 1.2.0

### Pre-update tasks
 
Prior to any update attempt, it is greatly recommended to deactivate all plugins through the plugin interface. Once the
update is done, you must re-activate the plugins one at a time. If something goes wrong with a plugin, you can post in
the plugins support section, and our development team will fix the issue as soon as possible.
 
### i-MSCP frontEnd access
 
i-MSCP 1.2.0 introduces support for the Nginx Web server which is currently used only by the i-MSCP frontEnd. From now,
the i-MSCP frontEnd is run through a dedicated httpd instance, and is reachable through the following http(s) ports:

```
8080 ( http )
4443 ( https )
```

You can set different ports by editing the /etc/imscp/imscp.conf file, and by re-running the i-MSCP installer. Be aware
that the common http(s) ports ( 80 and 443 ) are reserved, and therefore, must not be used. If you want keep access to
the panel though these ports, you can install the following plugin which will act as a proxy:

* https://github.com/i-MSCP/plugins/tree/master/incubator/PanelRedirect
 
Having the i-MSCP frontEnd running with a dedicated httpd instance means that even if your Apache instance is down, the
panel will stay reachable. You can manage the i-MSCP frontEnd service with the following commands:

```shell
# service imscp_panel <action>
# service nginx <action>
```

### Hook files / Listener files
 
Hooks files are now known as listener files. A listener file is a Perl script which contains one or many event listeners
registered on the events manager and triggered by the same. The old **/etc/imscp/hooks.d** directory has been renamed to
**/etc/imscp/listeners.d** directory for consistency reasons.
 
### Installer command line options
 
Many options were either added, removed or simply renamed. You can get the full list of available command line options
by running the following command:

```shell
# perl imscp-autoinstall -?
```
